# The Oversharer Challenge

## Challenge Description
    The challenge involves discovering an API endpoint that leaks sensitive information in the background. The target is a web application running at http://172.236.13.98:8888 that contains various API endpoints, one of which overshares user identity information.

## Solution

### Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance
    First, I navigated to the main application URL:


    http://172.236.13.98:8888
    The application appeared to be a web service with multiple API endpoints. I browsed through the visible interface to understand the application structure and identify potential endpoints.

### Step 2: Exploring the Forum Endpoint
    As hinted in the challenge description, I navigated to the forum endpoint:


    http://172.236.13.98:8888/forum
    This displayed a forum interface where users could presumably post messages and interact with the application.

### Step 3: Traffic Analysis with Proxy
    To intercept and analyze the background API calls, I used a web proxy (Burp Suite) to monitor the network traffic while interacting with the forum page.

    Process:

    Configured browser to use Burp Suite as proxy

    Enabled interception in Burp Suite

    Refreshed the forum page and interacted with its features

    Monitored all HTTP requests and responses

### Step 4: Discovering the Oversharing API
    While monitoring the traffic, I noticed several API calls being made in the background. One particular endpoint was leaking sensitive user information, including email addresses.

    The vulnerable API endpoint was:

    http://172.236.13.98:8888/community/api/v2/community/posts/
