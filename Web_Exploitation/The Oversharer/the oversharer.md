# The Oversharer CTF Challenge Guide

## Overview
This challenge involves a Dockerized API application that leaks sensitive information quietly in the background. Your goal is to create an account and capture the first exposed email address by intercepting API traffic.

## Setup Instructions

### STEP 0: Install Docker Compose

Download the docker-compose.yml file attached to the challenge. This file contains the configuration needed to run the challenge environment.

Pull the Docker image specified in the docker-compose file:

### STEP 1: Download docker-compose.yml
To manage the challenge container, install Docker Compose on your system:

*sudo apt install docker-compose*

### STEP 2: Pull the required Docker image

Pull the Docker image specified in the docker-compose file:

*sudo docker-compose pull*

### STEP 3: Start the challenge container

Start the container in detached mode with compatibility flag:

*sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --compatibility up -d*

### Verify Setup

Once the container is running, check the API is accessible by navigating to:

http://127.0.0.1:8888

You should see a login page. Routes are protected and require authentication.

### Challenge Objective

Create an account.

Intercept API traffic to capture the first email address exposed.

The email address is the flag.

Hint

The API leaks data quietly in the background, not through obvious endpoints.

Use Burp Suite or a similar proxy to intercept and inspect HTTP requests/responses.

The flag is found in the response from this API endpoint:

GET /community/api/v2/community


The exposed flag email address is:

#### robot001@example.com
