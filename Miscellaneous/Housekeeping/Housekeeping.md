# Housekeeping

## Description  
This challenge reminded us to **actually read the rules** before diving into the rest of the CTF. The description hinted that something might be hiding there…  

## Steps  
1. Open the **Rules page** from the CTF menu.  
2. The rules looked normal at first, but the challenge text and the free hint both suggested to *“view page source.”*

4. Right-click → **View Page Source**.

   _Viewing pae source:_

6. Hidden inside an HTML comment was the flag 🎉.  

## Flag  
```flag{inm_read_and_follow_the_rules}```


## Notes  
- The hint cost **0 points**, so even if you weren’t sure, **you could open it for free**.  
- This was designed as an **easy, warm-up challenge** to reward players with some free points (and maybe some hint currency for harder puzzles!).
